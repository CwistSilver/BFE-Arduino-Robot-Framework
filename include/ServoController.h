 * @brief Manages a servo motor's operations, including setup and angle adjustments.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the functionality needed to control a servo motor attached to the Arduino.
 * It provides methods to initialize the servo and set its angle within the conventional range of 0 to 180 degrees.
 * The class is designed to be used in conjunction with the Arduino Servo library.
 *
 * @note The setup() method must be called in your sketch's setup() function to properly initialize the servo hardware.
 *
 * @param pin The digital pin number on the Arduino board that the servo is connected to.
